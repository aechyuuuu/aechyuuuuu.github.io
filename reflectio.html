<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p id="ahah">In this quarter, it was hard, but I realized that it would be easy if I practiced really well in coding. Sometimes, I said to myself that I would practice, but some things got in the way. This whole school year was so far he best school year that I had in high school. It's not just because of the friends that I had along the way, but the best teachers that I had this quarter that made me love their subject even though I hated the subject because it's so challenging. These teachers made their subjects fun, and I would still get to laugh even though I was failing an activity. Ms. Uminga, I'm really happy that you became our teacher. ICT was sort of challenging to me the whole school year, but you made it fun to learn ICT. Thank you very much, Ms. We love you :))</p>
